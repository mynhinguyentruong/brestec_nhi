## Bresotec React Test

This project is a shell app that we have added a service to called GladiatorService.  Rather than accessing a database or API to retreive data, the GladiatorService reads in a CSV file and returns its contents as JSON.

The gladiators.csv contains a list of all of the American Gladiators, as well as the first and last years that they appeared on the show.

Your objective is to use the GladiatorService to get this list of gladiators, and display this information to the user in a readable and sensible way.  Style and presentation of the data are entirely up to you.  This is intended as an open-ended test, feel free to accomplish the task however you like.
